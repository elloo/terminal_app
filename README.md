# Don't Break the Chain!

[Don't Break the Chain!](https://github.com/elloo/terminal_app/commits/master "GitHub repository") is a Ruby terminal application for tracking daily progress of [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

## Functionality

This application comes with four simple commands:

1. Mark - creates "x" marks within the interface.
2. Delete - deletes "x" marks created in the same day.
3. Reset - clears the interface of all "x" marks.
4. Quit - exits the program.

This application was designed to track habitual behaviour over the period of 100 days. It allows for breaks in the "chain" and must be manually reset to re-initialise the starting date.

## Instructions for Use

Within the Command Line Interface (CLI):

1. Navigate to the containing folder using `cd`
2. Open the `src` folder
3. Type `ruby index.rb` into the CLI
4. Follow the on-screen prompt

## Brainstorming and Workflow

In the initial brainstorming phase, these [notes](docs/Brainstorm.pdf) were created. This is a list of the five different ideas that were generated within an hour. The possibilities included:

1. A mood tracker
2. Don't Break the Chain
3. Space Invaders
4. Bejeweled
5. A translation app

It was decided that agile methodology would be followed as it would be hard to accurately judge how long each feature would take to implement.

## Initial Design Specifications

The project was first intended to be a Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) application. After the first sprint, it was decided that updating or editing the application was not needed on moral grounds. 

### User Stories

The following user stories reflect the initial design specifications of this application.

- As Ewe Lin, I want to mark down the days I stick to a habit so that I can track my progress in #100DaysofCode
- As Ewe Lin, I want to be able to delete past entries so that I can make mistakes
- As Shun, I want to be able to change / update entries for previous days so that I can make marks irregularly.
- As Shun, I want to be able to view all entries so that I can gain an overview of my past behaviour

## Project Plan & Timeline

**First sprint** 

After some advice from the teacher, Don't Break the Chain was selected as the project to work on. Related gems were noted beforehand and they were immediately used to create the menu and box containing the grid. All basic functionality (mark, delete and reset) and writing / reading from a file were coded. This took approximately 13 hours. Unfortunately, this meant overlooking the planning phase for the higher-level structure. 

**Second sprint**

The UI of the application was sketched out. In addition, notes were made on how to improve the reset function and implement the day tracking feature. Changes were made to the structure of the code to reflect this sketch. A `quit` feature was also coded into the program, along with strategic use of `system "clear"`.

## Technical Difficulties

1. Writing and reading the file

   One of the first difficulties encountered was learning to write and read from a file properly. It took about 6 hours to solve this.
   
   From a suggestion for a previous class exercise, it was thought that YAML would be sufficient. However, this was corrected and a normal .txt file was used instead. This made things much more straightforward as YAML uses special structures for it's format whereas .txt files retain the familiar Ruby syntax.

   In order to add or delete a single, selected character within the 2D array that represented the grid, the file always had to be read directly before making a change to it.

   Another problem that occurred with writing the file was that it would append to the file when trying to reset, even though it was in write mode. This was due to the use of `<<` within the `reset` method. It was easily fixed by assigning an empty array at the start of the method. 

## Future Improvements

1. Add colours to signify effort
2. Add a reward (a rainbow effect on the marks) for completing 100 days
2. Translation

## Discussion

### Legal, moral, ethical, cultural and safety issues

It is important to note that this application is not directly affiliated in any way with [#100DaysofCode](https://100daysofcode.com "100 Days of Code").

This application was initially intended to allow the user to edit marks on any given day. On further consideration of the morality behind this function, it was decided that this feature be omitted from the application. This would prevent the user from falsifying earlier entries and enhance the authenticity of data.

### Social, political, cultural, racial, gender and international issues

[#100DaysofCode](https://100daysofcode.com "100 Days of Code") is a social campaign that encourages those people to code for 100 days in a row. 

The application relies on a few words ("Mark", "Delete", and "Reset") with functionality that can easily be discovered or translated. This is to minimise the non-intentional bias toward English-speaking cultures and races.
